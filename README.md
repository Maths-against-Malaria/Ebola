# Ebola
This is a model for an Ebola pandemic including several countermeasures. It was developed by Aliou Bouba, Kristina Helle, Kristan Schneider in 2020-22 and based on other work in the group 'Math against malaria'.

The baseline parameters are defined in 'parameters.py'. It is not recommended to change them there unless the model itself is to be changed; only the paths (pathResult, pathPlot) may need adaption, these folders have to exist. The 'functions.py' file contains all functions of the model and for plotting, it is not to be changed to generate and plot simulations.
To actually run simulations, run the function 'modelEbola' as done in 'scenarios.py' by calling it with the desired parameters. It creates files with the simulation results. The names of the files is written to the console (they all begin with 'ebola_', followed by the given string), they include all parameters such that the settings are preserved. The output of the console should be copied as it is, the lines are to be used as entries of the 'names' vector for plotting.
For plotting, run 'plotEbolaAllCumulative' as also done in 'scenarios.py'. It needs the scenario names as printed by 'modelEbola' as input to find the correct files. It shows all plots on the console, when the display is closed, the file is saved.
